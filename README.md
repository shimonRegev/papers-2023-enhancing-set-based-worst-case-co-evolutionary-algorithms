This repository contains the MATLAB code for the research presented in the paper 'Enhancing Set-based Worst-case Co-evolutionary Algorithms for Non-cooperative Multi-objective Multi-agent Problems', as conducted by Shimon Regev, Erella Eisenstadt-Matalon, Amiram Moshaiov, and Achiya Elyasaf. 

## Overview
The code includes the algorithms and experiments conducted in our research. The purpose of this repository is to facilitate the reproduction of the results outlined in the paper.

## Content
The repository contains the following:

* `Arenas/` - Contains the Arenas data used for the experiments.
* `Results/` - Contains output files generated from the algorithm.
### Code Files
* `Main_TSP_July.m` - The main script for running the experiments.
* Additional auxiliary functions used by the main script.

## How to run
To run the experiments, execute the `Main_TSP_July.m` script. This script performs a sequence of experiments and writes the results to the `Results/` directory.
